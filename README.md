This project is a template for a facebook bot.
The project is configured to use Watson Conversation.
Below are the setup instruction steps to get started with the project:

1. run npm install to install dependencies.
   - express-handlebars and moment are optional. Remove them before running install if you don't need them.
2. go to the env file and input all variables.
   - This requires a conversation instance, a conversation workspace and a facebook page with a webhook.
   - Check the conversation API in the .env file and change if necessary to the API of your region.
